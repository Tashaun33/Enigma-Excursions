Welcome,

to the Enigma Excursions Travel service and customer transactions, Analysis project.

The project is an analysis of data for business purpose from my client as a travel services operator and their valued customer transactions, in data form to discover meaningful patterns, trends and insights. My data anlysist skill has been called upon and has discovered that, this dataset has some interesting attributes, based  on and around travel services, provided and the customer transactions, such as TicketPrice, ReturnTrip, TripType, Age, Gender, TravelTime, and Region. It may be that future business client's or customers will find this helpful and naturally make Enigma Excursions it's first stop to call for travel logistics and quality.


 **Dataset content**
The dataset used were my ideas brought to life online with guidance from a Gen A.I. tool. For a realtime effect and realistic authentication.

The dataset contains the following columns:

* ReturnTrip
* TripType
* TravelTime
* TicketPrice
* Region
* Gender
* Age

I will conduct the project according to features such as beginning, middle and the end with conclusion.

something like for introduction, methodology, analysis, and conclusions


I found Excel helpful while i was planning my hypothesis, in that my data type (data type()) it had objects not just floats or intergers and for 1 hypothesis iIoptimised the data to get a clearer result in the Linear regression model. So in the column named Travel time instead of Am or Pm I replaced those with 0 for Am and 1 for Pm and that made a difference. It was from there I tweeked around a bit more and got a positve linear regression line, and the proof was clear to see.


As a quality check. including checks for consistency between fields   e.g Return trip vs Trip type 







 **hypothesis**

1.	Price Sensitivity Hypothesis
o	H₀: There is no difference in average ticket price across regions.
o	H₁: Average ticket price differs significantly across regions.

2.	Age and Ticket price Hypothesis
o	H₀: Age has no effect on ticket price.
o	H₁: Age influences ticket price.
  

3.	Gender and Spending Hypothesis
o	H₀: Average ticket price does not differ by gender.
o	H₁: Average ticket price differs significantly by gender.
  

4.	Travel Time and Ticket Price Relationship
o	H₀: There is no relationship between travel time and ticket price.
o	H₁: Ticket price increases with travel time.

I will use python as the programme written code,

I will use python libaries like, pandas, numpy and matplotlib to add depth and visualation in to Insights and findings of my project work.

I will use Gen A.I. in the design phase of my project and refer back to it during my projects development.

I have encounter errors, and mistakes along the way, thus far and have found reasonable solutions to issues rather than giving up an original idea.

 **Data management section**

Explanation: Data Collection, Cleaning, and Storage
1. Data Collection

The dataset was compiled to analyze travel patterns and ticket pricing behavior across different regions.
Data was collected through multiple sources:

Online survey forms distributed to travelers through travel agencies and booking platforms.

Transaction records from ticketing systems that included ticket price, trip type (e.g., one-way or return), and travel time.

Demographic details (age, gender, and region) were self-reported by respondents or recorded during booking.

Each record in the dataset represents an individual traveler’s booking. Data collection ensured that all entries were anonymous and complied with data protection regulations.

2. Data Cleaning and Preparation

Before analysis, several cleaning and preprocessing steps were applied to ensure accuracy and consistency:
During cleaning, summary statistics and visual inspections (e.g., boxplots for TicketPrice and histograms for Age) were used to validate corrections.

3. Data Storage and Management

After cleaning, the data was stored and managed as follows:

Storage Format:
The dataset was saved in .csv formats for compatibility and efficiency.

Version Control:
Different versions of the dataset (raw, cleaned, and preprocessed) were stored separately to maintain a transparent data lineage.

Organization:
Data files were organized in a project structure:


Access and Backup:
The cleaned dataset was uploaded to a shared drive or database with restricted access for collaborators. Regular backups were automated to ensure data integrity.

4. Process Management

The data preparation process was managed using a structured workflow:

Data documentation: Metadata (column descriptions, data sources, units) was maintained in a separate README or data dictionary.

Reproducibility: All cleaning and transformation steps were scripted in Python using Pandas.

Quality checks: Each stage (collection, cleaning, storage) included validation steps — such as checking value ranges, unique IDs, and consistency between fields.
